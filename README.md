## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Complete Beginners

If you have **no prior experience with Python**, don't worry! Follow these step-by-step instructions.

---

## üì• Step 1: Install Python

We recommend using **Anaconda**, which includes Python and many scientific packages pre-installed.

### For Mac Users:

1. **Download Anaconda:**
   - Go to [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   - Download the installer for macOS (choose the version for your chip: Intel or Apple Silicon/M1/M2)

2. **Install Anaconda:**
   - Open the downloaded `.pkg` file
   - Follow the installation wizard (accept defaults)
   
3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open **Terminal** (find it in Applications ‚Üí Utilities)
   - Type: `conda --version` and press Enter
   - You should see a version number (e.g., `conda 23.7.4`)

### For Windows Users:

1. **Download Anaconda:**
   - Go to [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   - Download the Windows installer (64-bit recommended)

2. **Install Anaconda:**
   - Run the downloaded `.exe` file
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - **Important:** Check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" if asked

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open **Anaconda Prompt** (search for it in the Start menu)
   - Type: `conda --version` and press Enter
   - You should see a version number

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

After installing Anaconda, you need to install additional packages required for the analysis.

### For Mac:

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Navigate to the Analysis_bootcamp folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/Analysis_bootcamp
   ```
   **Tip:** You can drag the folder from Finder into Terminal to automatically type the path.

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
   pip install ipympl scipy pyabf moviepy pandas pytables
   ```

### For Windows:

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt**
2. Navigate to the Analysis_bootcamp folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\path\to\your\Analysis_bootcamp
   ```
   (Replace with the actual path where you saved this folder)

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
   pip install ipympl scipy pyabf moviepy pandas pytables
   ```

**Note:** Installation may take a few minutes. Answer 'y' (yes) if prompted to proceed.

## üìì Step 3: Open and Run Jupyter Notebook

### For Mac:

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Navigate to the Analysis_bootcamp folder (if you're not already there):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/Analysis_bootcamp
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Your default web browser will open automatically showing the Jupyter interface
5. Click on **Day5_Introduction.ipynb** to open the tutorial notebook

### For Windows:

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt**
2. Navigate to the Analysis_bootcamp folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\path\to\your\Analysis_bootcamp
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Your default web browser will open automatically showing the Jupyter interface
5. Click on **Day5_Introduction.ipynb** to open the tutorial notebook

---

## üéØ Step 4: Running the Notebook

Once you have the notebook open in your browser:

1. **Run a single cell:**
   - Click on a cell (the boxes with code)
   - Press **Shift + Enter** to run the cell
   - The output will appear below the cell

2. **Run all cells:**
   - Go to the menu: **Cell ‚Üí Run All**

3. **Important Tips:**
   - Run cells in order from top to bottom
   - Some cells may take a few seconds to complete
   - If you see `[*]` next to a cell, it's still running
   - If you see `[1]`, `[2]`, etc., the cell has finished running

## üìö What You'll Learn

The **Day5_Introduction.ipynb** notebook covers:

1. **Loading electrophysiology data** from HDF5 and ABF files
2. **Visualizing raw traces** using matplotlib
3. **Filtering signals** with Bessel filters
4. **Detecting spikes** using peak detection algorithms
5. **Creating animations** of your data
6. **Generating audio** from spike recordings
7. **Merging audio and video** for presentations

After completing the introduction notebook, use **Day5_Your_Analysis.ipynb** to practice on your own data or explore the examples further.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Problem:** "conda: command not found" or "jupyter: command not found"
- **Solution:** Restart your Terminal/Anaconda Prompt after installing Anaconda, or close and reopen it.

**Problem:** Import errors when running cells (e.g., "No module named 'pyabf'")
- **Solution:** Make sure you ran the installation commands in Step 2. You can install missing packages individually:
  ```bash
  pip install pyabf
  ```

**Problem:** "No such file or directory" when loading data
- **Solution:** Make sure you're running the notebook from the correct folder (this Analysis_bootcamp folder).

**Problem:** Video/audio files not being created
- **Solution:** Make sure ffmpeg is installed correctly:
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
  ```
